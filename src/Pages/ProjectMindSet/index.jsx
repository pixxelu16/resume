      <p>
        The client approached us to build an identity for a platform centered on collaboration,
        long-term impact, and shared growth. The aim was to communicate how meaningful partnerships
        can create lasting change—starting from a single idea and expanding outward.
      </p>
      <p>
        They wanted a system that felt open, inclusive, and dynamic—something that could visually represent
        the belief that impact grows when people come together with a shared purpose. The concept needed to speak
        to continuous evolution, mutual growth, and the strength found in unity.
      </p>

  `The concept draws inspiration from <strong>ripples</strong> — a simple yet powerful symbol of how one idea or action can create<strong> lasting impact</strong>. Like a drop in water, it starts small but expands outward, touching more lives as it moves.`,
  `When two ripples meet, they create a moment of <strong>collaboration and synergy</strong> — a reflection of how partnerships can strengthen purpose and amplify outcomes. It’s not just about coming together, but about growing together.`,
  `At the point where the ripples intersect, they form an <strong>infinity symbol</strong> — representing the <strong>endless possibilities</strong> that emerge when people unite around a shared goal. It becomes a visual expression of continuous growth, shared impact, and the long-term change that true collaboration can bring.`,
  `This concept isn’t just about design — it’s about<strong> capturing the spirit of working together to create something that lasts.</strong>`
